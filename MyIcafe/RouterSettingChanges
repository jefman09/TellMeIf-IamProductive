I know what is the bug
-Due to insufficient storage so cannot save settings
-Due to the web monitoring is on in default that fill that limited space
-THe remedy is to delete the data of webmon folder inside of the router
-Another in my observation is need to delete data on bandwidth monitoring page regularly

I trying to repair and install the layer7 ung manually copying the files to the router
After reboot need to copy libxt_layer7.So and libxt_string.so to usr\lib\iptables of the router
and run modprobe....Failed


Layer 7 is not working
iptables: match "layer7" has version "libxtables.so.5", but "libxtables.so.10" is required.
