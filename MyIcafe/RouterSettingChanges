-Lowering the rate of the classes to dont overmax to the max upload, let see
-Max ping is 57 sa gateway while running dslreports/speedtest

-May bug talaga ung router ng ngayon dati wala naman after reboot mga 30 mins di na naman 
makasave ng settings
-Max ping is 73 sa gateway while running dslreports/speedtest bom my new setting in upload qos
I know what is the bug
-Due to insufficient storage so cannot save settings
-Due to the web monitoring is on in default that fill that limited space
-THe remedy is to delete the data of webmon folder inside of the router
